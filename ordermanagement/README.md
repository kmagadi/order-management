# High Throughput Order Management System

## Overview

This project implements a lightweight, high-throughput order management backend inspired by modern trading and e-commerce platforms. The system accepts orders via REST APIs, processes them concurrently, maintains in-memory order state, persists order activity to files, and provides real-time analytics.

The goal of this system is to simulate real-world backend infrastructure used in fintech, brokerage platforms, and large-scale e-commerce systems, with a focus on concurrency, scalability, fault tolerance, and clean architecture.

## System Design Explanation

### 1. Order Ingestion

The system begins by accepting order requests through REST APIs. This simulates real-world order intake systems used in trading desks, payment platforms, and e-commerce backends.

Each request is validated and converted into a domain object representing an order.

---

### 2. Layered Architecture

The application follows a clean layered structure:

* Controller → Handles HTTP requests
* Service → Business logic and orchestration
* Repository → In-memory storage
* Processor → Asynchronous execution
* Analytics → Stream-based computation

This design promotes scalability, testability, and maintainability.

---

### 3. Concurrent Order Processing

The system uses a fixed-size thread pool to process orders asynchronously.

Each worker:

* Updates order status
* Simulates execution or fulfillment
* Persists updates
* Logs audit records

This mimics real trading or order fulfillment engines where multiple streams process transactions concurrently.

---

### 4. Thread-Safe In-Memory Storage

Orders are stored in memory using `ConcurrentHashMap`.

This enables:

* Fast read/write operations
* Thread safety under concurrent load
* Real-time state tracking
* High throughput

This approach is commonly used in:

* Order books
* Risk engines
* Payment gateways
* Inventory systems

---

### 5. Order Lifecycle Management

Each order goes through a lifecycle:

* CREATED
* PROCESSING
* COMPLETED or FAILED

This allows real-time monitoring and supports analytics and debugging.

---

### 6. File-Based Audit Logging

Every order event is persisted in a log file.

This ensures:

* Auditability
* Compliance
* Traceability
* Debugging and recovery

Such logging is mandatory in regulated environments like financial systems.

---

### 7. Real-Time Analytics

The analytics module uses Java Streams to compute insights such as:

* Total order value
* BUY vs SELL distribution
* Top customer by volume
* Order grouping by status

This demonstrates modern functional programming and real-time computation.

---

### 8. Fault Tolerance and Resilience

The system is designed to continue processing even when some orders fail.

Failures are:

* Logged
* Marked as FAILED
* Handled using custom exceptions

This ensures system stability under unpredictable inputs.

---

### 9. Scalability and Extensibility

The architecture is modular and easily extensible to support:

* Event-driven processing
* Distributed order engines
* Database persistence
* Order matching engines
* Microservices architecture
* Cloud-native deployment
* Monitoring and observability

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will start on:

```
http://localhost:8080

### Sample API

Place an order:

```
POST /orders
```

Request body:

```
{
  "customerId": "CUST_001",
  "product": "AAPL",
  "orderType": "BUY",
  "quantity": 10,
  "price": 150
}
```

---

## Load Testing

The system supports concurrent load testing using multithreaded clients.

A Python script can be used to simulate multiple users sending requests simultaneously, validating system scalability and performance under high throughput.

---

## Future Improvements

* Kafka-based event-driven order ingestion
* Order matching engine
* Risk and compliance module
* Database persistence using JPA
* Distributed microservices architecture
* Monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana
* Virtual threads for ultra-high throughput
* Caching and rate limiting
* Cloud deployment and containerization
